# Stock Price Prediction with LSTM Model for Quantitative Trading

## Overview
This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model to predict stock prices for quantitative trading strategies. The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and leverages pandas and NumPy for data manipulation, and scikit-learn for preprocessing. The goal is to provide a tool that can assist in making informed trading decisions based on predicted price movements.

## Features
- **LSTM model for stock price prediction**: Utilizes deep learning to capture temporal dependencies in stock data.
- **Quantitative trading strategies**: Integration of predicted prices into trading algorithms for decision-making.
- **Preprocessing and normalization**: Data preparation using pandas and NumPy, with standardization via scikit-learn.
- **Evaluation metrics**: Assessment of model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
